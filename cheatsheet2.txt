Quick “what do I run when…”

Edited Blade/Controllers/Routes only

./scripts/deploy_remote.sh deploy@voicebot.tv.digital


(It’ll skip API rebuild; just refresh Laravel + health checks.)

Edited FastAPI Python (server/app), or requirements/Dockerfile

./scripts/deploy_remote.sh deploy@voicebot.tv.digital


(It detects the changes and rebuilds api automatically.)

Hot rebuild API only (you know you changed it)

./scripts/rebuild_api_remote.sh deploy@voicebot.tv.digital
